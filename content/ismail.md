Introduction:

Abraham, also known as Ibrahim or Ibraheem, is the earliest prophet mentioned in the Quran. His father's name is Azar. He has three children named Ismael, Ishaaq, and Yaqub. All three kids are considered prophets in the Quran.

Prophet Ismael is also called Ismail, Ishmael, and Ismail. He is the first son of Ibrahim. Ibrahim is also called Ibrahem, Abraham, and Ibraheem. The Quran mentions the wife of Ibrahim but does not mention her name. In some traditions, her first name is Sarah or Sara or Sarai. However, this is just a folk tale and cannot be proven by the Quran.

Ibrahim has two other sons. His second son's name is Ishaq, who is also called Isaac, Ishaq, or Ishaaq. Ibrahim's third son's name is Yaqoob, who is also known as Jacob. Jacob is not Israel, and in the Quran, Israel is mentioned as a separate person who is truthful.
It is also clear from the Quran that Ismael is the firstborn. The word "barren" (Aqeem) used for Ibrahim's wife is another word, "old" (Ajoz), meaning his wife was unable to have kids at an old age.

Ibrahim and Ismail story of Building the kabah in Makkah:

In the Quran chapter two, It is clear that Both Ibrahim and Ismail are present at the House of Allah.  Here they make supplication, because the supplication is in the plural form, and they ask for A RASOOL from their muslim progeny.  If Ismail is Mohammad then who is the Rasool Ibrahim is supplicating for?  It clearly points to the prophet Mohammad.  

وَإِذْ قَالَ إِبْرَٰهِـۧمُ رَبِّ ٱجْعَلْ هَـٰذَا بَلَدًا ءَامِنًۭا وَٱرْزُقْ أَهْلَهُۥ مِنَ ٱلثَّمَرَٰتِ مَنْ ءَامَنَ مِنْهُم بِٱللَّهِ وَٱلْيَوْمِ ٱلْـَٔاخِرِ ۖ قَالَ وَمَن كَفَرَ فَأُمَتِّعُهُۥ قَلِيلًۭا ثُمَّ أَضْطَرُّهُۥٓ إِلَىٰ عَذَابِ ٱلنَّارِ ۖ وَبِئْسَ ٱلْمَصِيرُ ١٢٦ وَإِذْ يَرْفَعُ إِبْرَٰهِـۧمُ ٱلْقَوَاعِدَ مِنَ ٱلْبَيْتِ وَإِسْمَـٰعِيلُ رَبَّنَا تَقَبَّلْ مِنَّآ ۖ إِنَّكَ أَنتَ ٱلسَّمِيعُ ٱلْعَلِيمُ ١٢٧ رَبَّنَا وَٱجْعَلْنَا مُسْلِمَيْنِ لَكَ وَمِن ذُرِّيَّتِنَآ أُمَّةًۭ مُّسْلِمَةًۭ لَّكَ وَأَرِنَا مَنَاسِكَنَا وَتُبْ عَلَيْنَآ ۖ إِنَّكَ أَنتَ ٱلتَّوَّابُ ٱلرَّحِيمُ ١٢٨ رَبَّنَا وَٱبْعَثْ فِيهِمْ رَسُولًۭا مِّنْهُمْ يَتْلُوا۟ عَلَيْهِمْ ءَايَـٰتِكَ وَيُعَلِّمُهُمُ ٱلْكِتَـٰبَ وَٱلْحِكْمَةَ وَيُزَكِّيهِمْ ۚ إِنَّكَ أَنتَ ٱلْعَزِيزُ ٱلْحَكِيمُ ١٢٩ وَمَن يَرْغَبُ عَن مِّلَّةِ إِبْرَٰهِـۧمَ إِلَّا مَن سَفِهَ نَفْسَهُۥ ۚ وَلَقَدِ ٱصْطَفَيْنَـٰهُ فِى ٱلدُّنْيَا ۖ وَإِنَّهُۥ فِى ٱلْـَٔاخِرَةِ لَمِنَ ٱلصَّـٰلِحِينَ ١٣٠ إِذْ قَالَ لَهُۥ رَبُّهُۥٓ أَسْلِمْ ۖ قَالَ أَسْلَمْتُ لِرَبِّ ٱلْعَـٰلَمِينَ ١٣١


Verse 124. And when Abraham's Allah entrusted Abraham with sacred words, and he fulfilled them by praising Allah using those words. Allah then said, “I am making you a leader of humanity.” Abraham requested, “And my descendants?” Allah said, “My pledge does not include the wrongdoers.”

Verse 125. And Allah made the House of Allah meaning kabah a focal point for the people, and a sanctuary. Allah ordered to use the house of Allah and the place where Abraham stood as a place of prayer. And Allah commissioned Abraham and Ishmael, “Sanctify My House for those who circle around it, and those who seclude themselves in it, and those who kneel and prostrate.”

Verse 126. When Abraham said, “O My Creator, make this place of kabah in Makkah peaceful land, and provide its people with fruits—whoever of them believes in Allah and the Last Day.” He said, “And whoever disbelieves, I will give him a little enjoyment, then I will consign him to the punishment of the Fire; how miserable the destiny!”

Verse 127. As Abraham raises the foundations of the House, together with Ishmael saying, “Our Lord, accept it from us, You are the Hearer, the Knower.

Verse 128. Our Lord, and make us among the Muslims, and from our descendants a community who always stays Muslims and submitted to you. And show us our rites of Hajj, and accept our repentance. You are the Acceptor of Repentance, the Merciful.

Verse 129. Abraham and Ismael make supplication saying Our Lord, and raise up among our Muslim Progeny a messenger (Prophet Mohammad), from themselves, who will recite to them Your revelations, and teach them the Book and wisdom, and purify them. You are the Almighty, the Wise.”

Verse 130. Who would forsake the religion of Abraham, except he who fools himself? We chose him in this world, and in the Hereafter he will be among the righteous.

Verse 131. When his Lord said to Abraham, “Submit!” He said, “I have submitted to the Lord of the Worlds.”


Ibrahim and Ismael story of Sacrifice:

This story is in Quran and according the the story no one was sacrificed. The story of sacrifice has more to do with the separation of father and his beloved son Ismael.
The dream of Ibrahim in the Quran 3:102 is about Allah asking him to cast away his son (Ismael) and leave him in Makkah. It is a great trial of separation between the beloved father and the son.

Once Ibrahim understood the dream, where Allah asked him to cast away his son and leave him in Makkah, he told his son (Ismael) and asked for his opinion. The son replied, 'O father, do as you see fit; you will find me among the ones who persevere.'

Now comes the interesting part. As you may have seen in my old post where I discussed the use of foreign words in the Quran, I showed you how Allah used 'Darham' instead of 'Dinar.'

Well, you will be surprised that in the next verse, 3:103, Allah used words from two different cultures, giving you the trail of Ibrahim from the Indus Valley to Persia and finally to Arabia.

'Talla' is not an Arabic word; it has its roots in Sanskrit. According to Yates Sanskrit-English Dictionary, 'Talla' (तल्ल) means a reservoir or large tank, a hole, a pit, a deep place.

'Jabin/Jabeen' is also not from the Arabic language; it has Hebrew/Persian origin, meaning pure, beautiful, the one who is distinguished. In Persian and Indo/Pak, girls' names like Mah-Jabin mean extremely pure or beautiful. Additionally, the River Ganga's name in Persian is 'Jabeen.' We all know that Ganga is a sacred river representing the Goddess of purity and cleanser of sins.

Hence, the correct translation of 37:103 is, 'They both submitted to Allah, and He created a reservoir (well) for it (Zamzam) for the ones who are pure.'

As you continue to read the verse, Allah not only accepted his significant sacrifice of separation from his beloved son but also rewarded Ibrahim with two extra sons, Ishaq and Yaqoob



Criticism on the fabricated story of Hajjar and that Ismail was left in Makkah at a very young age:

The basic criticism on this narrative that Ismail was left in Makkah at young age and that ishaq instead of Ismael was sacrificed is that it is against the Qur’ān on three grounds.
Firstly, it is against the statements of the Qur’ān regarding a major event mentioned in it. It can be inferred quite convincingly from the Qur’ān that when Abraham (sws) settled Ishmael (sws) in Makkah he was a grown up boy and not an infant who was being suckled by his mother. Briefly stated, this inference can be made from the following established historical facts stated by the Qur’ān.
i. When Abraham (sws) settled Ishmael in Makkah, his younger brother Isaac (sws) had already been born. 
ii. Isaac (sws) was born only after Abraham (sws) had offered his son Ishmael (sws) for sacrifice at the behest of Almighty. The news of his birth was actually given to Abraham (sws) as a reward for his heroic feat.
iii. At the time of sacrifice Ishmael (sws) was young boy who could run around.
Keeping the above facts in mind, it can be deduced:
a. It follows from ii, iii and iv that the difference in age of the two brothers Ishmael (sws) and Isaac (sws) must have been a good ten or twelve years.
b. It follows from a and i that Ishmael (sws) must have been a young lad when he came to Makkah with his father to settle there.
Here are the Qur’ān verses which provide the information from i to iii:

وَ اِذۡ  قَالَ اِبۡرٰہِیۡمُ رَبِّ اجۡعَلۡ ہٰذَا الۡبَلَدَ  اٰمِنًا وَّ اجۡنُبۡنِیۡ وَ بَنِیَّ  اَنۡ نَّعۡبُدَ  الۡاَصۡنَامَ ﴿ؕ۳۵﴾  رَبِّ اِنَّہُنَّ اَضۡلَلۡنَ  کَثِیۡرًا مِّنَ النَّاسِ ۚ فَمَنۡ تَبِعَنِیۡ فَاِنَّہٗ  مِنِّیۡ ۚ وَ مَنۡ عَصَانِیۡ فَاِنَّکَ غَفُوۡرٌ  رَّحِیۡمٌ  ﴿۳۶﴾رَبَّنَاۤ  اِنِّیۡۤ  اَسۡکَنۡتُ مِنۡ ذُرِّیَّتِیۡ بِوَادٍ غَیۡرِ  ذِیۡ  زَرۡعٍ عِنۡدَ  بَیۡتِکَ  الۡمُحَرَّمِ ۙ رَبَّنَا لِیُـقِیۡمُوا الصَّلٰوۃَ فَاجۡعَلۡ اَفۡئِدَۃً مِّنَ النَّاسِ تَہۡوِیۡۤ اِلَیۡہِمۡ وَارۡ زُقۡہُمۡ مِّنَ الثَّمَرٰتِ لَعَلَّہُمۡ یَشۡکُرُوۡنَ ﴿۳۷﴾ رَبَّنَاۤ  اِنَّکَ تَعۡلَمُ مَا نُخۡفِیۡ وَ مَا نُعۡلِنُ ؕ وَ مَا یَخۡفٰی عَلَی اللّٰہِ مِنۡ شَیۡءٍ  فِی الۡاَرۡضِ  وَ لَا  فِی  السَّمَآءِ ﴿۳۸﴾ اَلۡحَمۡدُ لِلّٰہِ الَّذِیۡ وَہَبَ لِیۡ عَلَی الۡکِبَرِ  اِسۡمٰعِیۡلَ وَ اِسۡحٰقَ ؕ اِنَّ  رَبِّیۡ لَسَمِیۡعُ  الدُّعَآءِ ﴿۳۹﴾ رَبِّ اجۡعَلۡنِیۡ مُقِیۡمَ الصَّلٰوۃِ  وَ مِنۡ ذُرِّیَّتِیۡ ٭ۖ رَبَّنَا وَ تَقَبَّلۡ دُعَآءِ ﴿۴۰﴾ 

Narrate to them the incident when Abraham prayed: “Lord! Make this city a city of peace and distance me and my progeny from worshipping idols. Lord! These idols have led many astray. [They can also lead astray my progeny;] so, he [among them] who follows me is mine and he who disobeyed me, [his matter is consigned to you.] Then You are Forgiving and Ever-Merciful. Lord! I have settled some of my progeny near your sacred House in a barren valley. Lord! that they show diligence in the prayer [in this House]. So, incline the hearts of people towards them and grant them sustenance of fruits so that they may be grateful [to You]. Lord! You know what we conceal and what we reveal. In reality, nothing is hidden from God, neither in the earth nor in the heavens. Gratitude be to God Who has blessed me with Ishmael and Isaac in this old age. (14:35-39)

This is the prayer uttered by Abraham (sws) when he was settling Ishmael (sws) in Makkah. The words of the prayer “gratitude be to God Who has blessed me with Ishmael and Isaac in this old age,” clearly say that both Ishmael (sws) and Isaac (sws) had been born.
Now consider the following verses:

فَلَمَّا بَلَغَ مَعَہُ  السَّعۡیَ قَالَ یٰبُنَیَّ  اِنِّیۡۤ اَرٰی فِی الۡمَنَامِ اَنِّیۡۤ  اَذۡبَحُکَ فَانۡظُرۡ مَاذَا تَرٰی ؕ قَالَ یٰۤاَبَتِ افۡعَلۡ مَا تُؤۡمَرُ ۫ سَتَجِدُنِیۡۤ  اِنۡ شَآءَ اللّٰہُ مِنَ الصّٰبِرِیۡنَ ﴿۱۰۲﴾  فَلَمَّاۤ   اَسۡلَمَا وَ  تَلَّہٗ   لِلۡجَبِیۡنِ ﴿۱۰۳﴾ۚ  وَ  نَادَیۡنٰہُ  اَنۡ  یّٰۤاِبۡرٰہِیۡمُ ﴿۱۰۴﴾ۙ قَدۡ صَدَّقۡتَ الرُّءۡیَا ۚ اِنَّا کَذٰلِکَ نَجۡزِی الۡمُحۡسِنِیۡنَ ﴿۱۰۵﴾  اِنَّ ہٰذَا لَہُوَ  الۡبَلٰٓـؤُا الۡمُبِیۡنُ ﴿۱۰۶﴾  وَ فَدَیۡنٰہُ  بِذِبۡحٍ عَظِیۡمٍ ﴿۱۰۷﴾  وَ تَرَکۡنَا عَلَیۡہِ فِی الۡاٰخِرِیۡنَ ﴿۱۰۸﴾ۖ  سَلٰمٌ  عَلٰۤی  اِبۡرٰہِیۡمَ ﴿۱۰۹﴾  کَذٰلِکَ نَجۡزِی الۡمُحۡسِنِیۡنَ ﴿۱۱۰﴾  اِنَّہٗ مِنۡ عِبَادِنَا الۡمُؤۡمِنِیۡنَ ﴿۱۱۱﴾  وَ بَشَّرۡنٰہُ بِاِسۡحٰقَ نَبِیًّا مِّنَ الصّٰلِحِیۡنَ ﴿۱۱۲﴾
And, when his son was old enough to walk with him, he said: “O my son! I have been seeing in a dream that I am separating you from me [for Allah]. So consider this matter and let me know what you think!?” He said: “O my father! Do that which you are commanded, God willing, you shall find me of the patient.” Then, when they had both submitted themselves and he build a reservoir for zamzam for the people who are distinguished. We called out to him: “O Abraham! You have made the dream a reality.” Indeed, thus do We reward the good-doers. Verily, that indeed was a manifest trial. And We ransomed him with a great sacrifice and We left for him [a goodly remembrance] among the later generations. Peace be upon Abraham! Thus indeed do We reward the good-doers. Verily, he was one of Our believing slaves. And We gave him the glad tidings of Isaac – a Prophet from the righteous. (37:99-112)

It can be seen from the underlined part of these verses (And We gave him the glad tidings of Isaac) that it was after the incident of sacrifice of Ishmael (sws) that Abraham (sws) was given glad tidings of the birth of Isaac (sws). In other words, Isaac (sws) was not even born at the time Ishmael (sws) was offered for sacrifice of separation from his father. Now the opening words of these set of verses show that Ishmael (sws) must have been a budding youngster at that time (when his son was old enough to walk with him). 
In other words, this would mean that Ishmael (sws) was a young lad who was a fair bit older than Isaac (sws) and can easily be construed that the difference between the two brothers must have been more than 10-12 years. Since both these sons were already born to Abraham (sws) when he settled Ishmael (sws) in Makkah, it would mean that Ishmael (sws) must have been a youth of budding age at that time and not an infant as this narrative alleges.
 
It may thus be concluded by all counts that it is historically incorrect that Ishmael (sws) would have been an infant when he came to Makkah with his mother.
Secondly, the narrative depicts Abraham’s (sws) personality in direct contradiction of how the Qur’ān mentions him. The narrative portrays Abraham (sws) as a cruel father and husband who left his son and wife all by themselves in the desolate wilderness of Makkah.
In the first instance, he never bothered to carry the burden and the provisions in the journey. It was only Hagar who was left to carry them.
Secondly, he did not provide them with enough provisions and supplies to survive there. 
Thirdly, it is mentioned in some variants that Hagar called to him several times to find out the reason for leaving her and Ishmael (sws) but he never answered back. It was only when she herself came up with a probable reason that she was perhaps being left there because God had ordered him did he answer in the affirmative. 
Fourthly, it was only after a considerable period of time that he thought of visiting them again. This is evident from the fact that the narrative states that Ishmael (sws) had already got married by that time. It is strange that he never thought of visiting them in this whole period from the time Abraham, also known as Ibrahim or Ibraheem, is the earliest prophet mentioned in the Quran. His father's name is Azar. He has three children named Ismael, Ishaaq, and Yaqub. All three kids are considered prophets in the Quran.

Prophet Ismael is also called Ismail, Ishmael, and Ismail. He is the first son of Ibrahim. Ibrahim is also called Ibrahem, Abraham, and Ibraheem. The Quran mentions the wife of Ibrahim but does not mention her name. In some traditions, her first name is Sarah or Sara or Sarai. However, this is just a folk tale and cannot be proven by the Quran.

Ibrahim has two other sons. His second son's name is Ishaq, who is also called Isaac, Ishaq, or Ishaaq. Ibrahim's third son's name is Yaqoob, who is also known as Jacob. Jacob is not Israel, and in the Quran, Israel is mentioned as a separate prophet.

It is also clear from the Quran that Ismael is the firstborn. The word "barren" (Aqeem) used for Ibrahim's wife is another word, "old" (Ajoz), meaning his wife was unable to have kids at an old age.

Ibrahim and Ismail story of Building the kabah in Makkah:

In the Quran chapter two, it is clear that Ibrahim and Ismail raised the foundation of the Kaabah. It can also have other esoteric meanings but let us stay with the obvious meaning for this article. It is clearly stated in the verse that they made supplication for A PROPHET FROM THEIR MUSLIM PROGENY. They did not ask for multiple but a single prophet, and if that single prophet is not Muhammad than who else that could be? This is most conclusive evidence that Mohammad is not only from the progeny of Ibrahim and Ismail, but he is the only prophet in their progeny.

وَإِذْ قَالَ إِبْرَٰهِـۧمُ رَبِّ ٱجْعَلْ هَـٰذَا بَلَدًا ءَامِنًۭا وَٱرْزُقْ أَهْلَهُۥ مِنَ ٱلثَّمَرَٰتِ مَنْ ءَامَنَ مِنْهُم بِٱللَّهِ وَٱلْيَوْمِ ٱلْـَٔاخِرِ ۖ قَالَ وَمَن كَفَرَ فَأُمَتِّعُهُۥ قَلِيلًۭا ثُمَّ أَضْطَرُّهُۥٓ إِلَىٰ عَذَابِ ٱلنَّارِ ۖ وَبِئْسَ ٱلْمَصِيرُ ١٢٦ وَإِذْ يَرْفَعُ إِبْرَٰهِـۧمُ ٱلْقَوَاعِدَ مِنَ ٱلْبَيْتِ وَإِسْمَـٰعِيلُ رَبَّنَا تَقَبَّلْ مِنَّآ ۖ إِنَّكَ أَنتَ ٱلسَّمِيعُ ٱلْعَلِيمُ ١٢٧ رَبَّنَا وَٱجْعَلْنَا مُسْلِمَيْنِ لَكَ وَمِن ذُرِّيَّتِنَآ أُمَّةًۭ مُّسْلِمَةًۭ لَّكَ وَأَرِنَا مَنَاسِكَنَا وَتُبْ عَلَيْنَآ ۖ إِنَّكَ أَنتَ ٱلتَّوَّابُ ٱلرَّحِيمُ ١٢٨ رَبَّنَا وَٱبْعَثْ فِيهِمْ رَسُولًۭا مِّنْهُمْ يَتْلُوا۟ عَلَيْهِمْ ءَايَـٰتِكَ وَيُعَلِّمُهُمُ ٱلْكِتَـٰبَ وَٱلْحِكْمَةَ وَيُزَكِّيهِمْ ۚ إِنَّكَ أَنتَ ٱلْعَزِيزُ ٱلْحَكِيمُ ١٢٩ وَمَن يَرْغَبُ عَن مِّلَّةِ إِبْرَٰهِـۧمَ إِلَّا مَن سَفِهَ نَفْسَهُۥ ۚ وَلَقَدِ ٱصْطَفَيْنَـٰهُ فِى ٱلدُّنْيَا ۖ وَإِنَّهُۥ فِى ٱلْـَٔاخِرَةِ لَمِنَ ٱلصَّـٰلِحِينَ ١٣٠ إِذْ قَالَ لَهُۥ رَبُّهُۥٓ أَسْلِمْ ۖ قَالَ أَسْلَمْتُ لِرَبِّ ٱلْعَـٰلَمِينَ ١٣١

So, incline the hearts of people towards them and grant them sustenance of fruits so that they may be grateful [to You]. Lord! You know what we conceal and what we reveal. In reality, nothing is hidden from God, neither in the earth nor in the heavens. Gratitude be to God Who has blessed me with Ishmael and Isaac in this old age. (14:35-39)

This is the prayer uttered by Abraham (sws) when he was settling Ishmael (sws) in Makkah. The words of the prayer “gratitude be to God Who has blessed me with Ishmael and Isaac in this old age,” clearly say that both Ishmael (sws) and Isaac (sws) had been born.

Now consider the following verses:

فَلَمَّا بَلَغَ مَعَہُ السَّعۡیَ قَالَ یٰبُنَیَّ اِنِّیۡۤ اَرٰی فِی الۡمَنَامِ اَنِّیۡۤ اَذۡبَحُکَ فَانۡظُرۡ مَاذَا تَرٰی ؕ قَالَ یٰۤاَبَتِ افۡعَلۡ مَا تُؤۡمَرُ ۫ سَتَجِدُنِیۡۤ اِنۡ شَآءَ اللّٰہُ مِنَ الصّٰبِرِیۡنَ ﴿۱۰۲﴾ فَلَمَّاۤ اَسۡلَمَا وَ تَلَّہٗ لِلۡجَبِیۡنِ ﴿۱۰۳﴾ۚ وَ نَادَیۡنٰہُ اَنۡ یّٰۤاِبۡرٰہِیۡمُ ﴿۱۰۴﴾ۙ قَدۡ صَدَّقۡتَ الرُّءۡیَا ۚ اِنَّا کَذٰلِکَ نَجۡزِی الۡمُحۡسِنِیۡنَ ﴿۱۰۵﴾ اِنَّ ہٰذَا لَہُوَ الۡبَلٰٓـؤُا الۡمُبِیۡنُ ﴿۱۰۶﴾ وَ فَدَیۡنٰہُ بِذِبۡحٍ عَظِیۡمٍ ﴿۱۰۷﴾ وَ تَرَکۡنَا عَلَیۡہِ فِی الۡاٰخِرِیۡنَ ﴿۱۰۸﴾ۖ سَلٰمٌ عَلٰۤی اِبۡرٰہِیۡمَ ﴿۱۰۹﴾ کَذٰلِکَ نَجۡزِی الۡمُحۡسِنِیۡنَ ﴿۱۱۰﴾ اِنَّہٗ مِنۡ عِبَادِنَا الۡمُؤۡمِنِیۡنَ ﴿۱۱۱﴾ وَ بَشَّرۡنٰہُ بِاِسۡحٰقَ نَبِیًّا مِّنَ الصّٰلِحِیۡنَ ﴿۱۱۲﴾

And, when his son was old enough to walk with him, he said: “O my son! I have been seeing in a dream that I am separating you from me [for Allah]. So consider this matter and let me know what you think!?” He said: “O my father! Do that which you are commanded, God willing, you shall find me of the patient.” Then, when they had both submitted themselves and he build a reservoir for zamzam for the people who are distinguished. We called out to him: “O Abraham! You have made the dream a reality.” Indeed, thus do We reward the good-doers. Verily, that indeed was a manifest trial. And We ransomed him with a great sacrifice and We left for him [a goodly remembrance] among the later generations. Peace be upon Abraham! Thus indeed do We reward the good-doers. Verily, he was one of Our believing slaves. And We gave him the glad tidings of Isaac – a Prophet from the righteous. (37:99-112)

It can be seen from the underlined part of these verses (And We gave him the glad tidings of Isaac) that it was after the incident of separation of Ishmael (sws) that Abraham (sws) was given glad tidings of the birth of Isaac (sws). In other words, Isaac (sws) was not even born at the time Ishmael (sws) was separated from his father. Now the opening words of these set of verses show that Ishmael (sws) must have been a budding youngster at that time (when his son was old enough to walk with him).

In other words, this would mean that Ishmael (sws) was a young lad who was a fair bit older than Isaac (sws) and can easily be construed that the difference between the two brothers must have been more than 10-12 years. Since both these sons were already born to Abraham (sws) when he settled Ishmael (sws) in Makkah, it would mean that Ishmael (sws) must have been a youth of budding age at that time and not an infant as this narrative alleges.

It may thus be concluded by all counts that it is historically incorrect that Ishmael (sws) would have been an infant when he came to Makkah with his mother.

Secondly, the narrative depicts Abraham’s (sws) personality in direct contradiction of how the Qur’ān mentions him. The narrative portrays Abraham (sws) as a cruel father and husband who left his son and wife all by themselves in the desolate wilderness of Makkah.

In the first instance, he never bothered to carry the burden and the provisions in the journey. It was only Hagar who was left to carry them.

Secondly, he did not provide them with enough provisions and supplies to survive there.

Thirdly, it is mentioned in some variants that Hagar called to him several times to find out the reason for leaving her and Ishmael (sws) but he never answered back. It was only when she herself came up with a probable reason that she was perhaps being left there because God had ordered him did he answer in the affirmative.

Fourthly, it was only after a considerable period of time that he thought of visiting them again. This is evident from the fact that the narrative states that Ishmael (sws) had already got married by that time. It is strange that he never thought of visiting them in this whole period from the time he had left Ishmael as a helpless infant to the time he grew up to marriageable age.

How thoroughly unbecoming of a celebrated patriarch praised profusely by the Qur’ān. Here are some gleanings:

وَ اتَّخَذَ اللّٰہُ اِبۡرٰہِیۡمَ خَلِیۡلًا. (125:4)

God had chosen Abraham to be His friend. (4:125)

اِنَّ اِبۡرٰہِیۡمَ لَحَلِیۡمٌ اَوَّاہٌ مُّنِیۡبٌ. (75:11)

In reality, Abraham was very gracious and very affectionate and one who was very focused towards his Lord. (11:75)

اِنَّ اِبۡرٰہِیۡمَ کَانَ اُمَّۃً قَانِتًا لِّلّٰہِ حَنِیۡفًا ؕ وَ لَمۡ یَکُ مِنَ الۡمُشۡرِکِیۡنَ. شَاکِرًا لِّاَنۡعُمِہٖ ؕ اِجۡتَبٰہُ وَ ہَدٰىہُ اِلٰی صِرَاطٍ مُّسۡتَقِیۡمٍ. وَ اٰتَیۡنٰہُ فِی الدُّنۡیَا حَسَنَۃً ؕ وَ اِنَّہٗ فِی الۡاٰخِرَۃِ لَمِنَ الصّٰلِحِیۡنَ. (16: 120۔122)

In reality, Abraham was an ummah [in his own self,] obedient to God and devoted and he was not from among the polytheists. He was grateful for His favours. God chose him and had guided him towards a straight path. We granted him goodness in this world also and in the Hereafter as well also he will be from among the righteous. (16: 120-122)

اِذۡ جَآءَ رَبَّہٗ بِقَلۡبٍ سَلِیۡمٍ. (84:37)

And [Abraham] came to his Lord with a pure heart. (37:84)

وَ اِبۡرٰہِیۡمَ الَّذِیۡ وَفّٰۤی .(37:53)

And of Abraham, who was befittingly loyal. (53:37)


And Allah knows best.
